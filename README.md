# Airbnb Dataset Analysis 

## Overview
I conducted an in-depth analysis of Airbnb data, exploring various columns such as neighborhoods, prices, room types, and bed configurations. Using Python, I not only performed the analysis but also created insightful visualizations utilizing Seaborn and Matplotlib. Through this comprehensive examination, I uncovered several key insights, which I have presented in detail.

### Importing libraries  
I imported the necessary libraries, including pandas, seaborn, numpy, and matplotlib, to facilitate data analysis and visualization.
```pyt
import pandas as pd 
import seaborn as sb
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
### Exploring Datasets 
I imported the necessary libraries, including pandas, seaborn, numpy, and matplotlib, to facilitate data analysis and visualization.
```pyt
df.tail(2)
df.shape
df.info()
df.describe()
df.isnull().sum()
```
