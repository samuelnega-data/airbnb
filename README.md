# Airbnb Dataset Analysis 

## Overview
I conducted an in-depth analysis of Airbnb data, exploring various columns such as neighborhoods, prices, room types, and bed configurations. Using Python, I not only performed the analysis but also created insightful visualizations utilizing Seaborn and Matplotlib. Through this comprehensive examination, I uncovered several key insights, which I have presented in detail.
